# Metabolic Tampering (MeTa) repository

Documentation and models from *Facilitating NMR Resonance Assignment with Metabolic Tampering*.
Authors: Danica Cui, Evan Anderson, Erik Zabala, George Lisi, J. Patrick Loria


In our upcoming publication *Facilitating NMR Resonance Assignment with Metabolic Tampering*, we describe a new method to aid in assignment of amino acids in NMR experiments. As a part of this publication, we describe implementation of a random forests classifier to classify amino acid identify in 2D <sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments with varying, small amounts of enriched LB media. This repository serves as documentation for implementation and validation of this model, and also provides templates for implementation of this model by other users.
